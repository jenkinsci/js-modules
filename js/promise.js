/*
 * Very simple "Promise" impl.
 * <p>
 * Intentionally not using the "promise" module/polyfill because it will add a few Kb and we 
 * only need something very simple here. We really just want to follow the main pattern
 * and don't need some of the fancy stuff.
 * <p>
 * I think so long as we stick to same interface/interaction pattern as outlined in the link
 * below, then we can always switch to the "promise" module later without breaking anything.
 * <p>
 * See https://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise
